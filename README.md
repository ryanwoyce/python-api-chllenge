# python-api-chllenge
Within this repository is all of the files required for the Module 6 Challenge.

The file 'Weather.ipynb' and VacationPy.ipynb' include the code required for each of the parts of the challenge.

The .png files are the charts that I saved from the 'WeatherPy.ipynb' code.

The cities.csv file is the data that i refrenced in both parts of the challenge. 

I had some trouble getting my API keys to work for the 'VacationPy" part of the challenge
and struggled to write the proper code for the requiremtns but I filled it ou to the best of my current ability.
